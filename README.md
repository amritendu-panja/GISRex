# WebGIS - Web-Based Geographical Tool with Vector and Raster Layers

The Web-Based Geographical Tool is a powerful application that allows users to visualize and analyze geographical data through vector and raster layers. This tool supports various map visualizations, including heatmaps and choropleth maps, providing valuable insights into spatial data. The application is built using a .NET Core backend, PostgreSQL database, and an Angular frontend.

## Features

- **Map Visualization:** Users can visualize geographical data using interactive maps.
- **Vector Layers:** Display vector-based geographical data, such as points, lines, and polygons.
- **Raster Layers:** Display raster images and data, enabling visualization of complex spatial information.
- **Heatmap:** Generate heatmaps to identify patterns and concentrations within the data.
- **Choropleth Map:** Create choropleth maps to visualize data distribution across regions.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization ensure data privacy.
- **Database Integration:** Utilize PostgreSQL to store and manage geographical data efficiently.
- **Responsive Design:** The Angular frontend offers a responsive and intuitive user interface for various devices.

## System Architecture

The system architecture consists of three main components: the .NET Core backend, PostgreSQL database, and Angular frontend.

### Backend (.NET Core)

The backend is developed using .NET Core, providing the necessary APIs for the frontend to interact with the application's functionality. It handles data processing, authentication, and communication with the database.

Key Technologies:
- .NET Core
- RESTful APIs

### Database (PostgreSQL)

The PostgreSQL database stores geographical data, user information, and application-related data. It ensures data integrity and provides efficient data retrieval for visualization and analysis.

Key Features:
- Store geographical vector and raster data
- Store user authentication and authorization data
- Optimize queries for efficient spatial data retrieval

### Frontend (Angular)

The Angular frontend offers an interactive user interface for users to visualize and analyze geographical data. It communicates with the backend through APIs to fetch data and display it on the map.

Key Features:
- Interactive map display
- Vector and raster layer visualization
- Heatmap and choropleth map generation
- User authentication and authorization management

## Setup and Deployment

To set up and deploy the Web-Based Geographical Tool, follow these steps:

1. **Backend Setup:**
   - Install .NET Core SDK.
   - Clone the backend repository.
   - Configure database connection settings.
   - Build and run the backend using `dotnet run`.

2. **Database Setup:**
   - Install PostgreSQL.
   - Create a database and tables as per the defined schema.
   - Populate sample data if necessary.

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Install Node.js and Angular CLI.
   - Clone the frontend repository.
   - Configure API endpoints in the frontend code.
   - Run the frontend using `ng serve`.

4. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the backend and frontend to appropriate hosting services.
   - Configure production-ready settings, such as database connection pooling and security measures.

## Conclusion

The Web-Based Geographical Tool offers a comprehensive solution for visualizing and analyzing geographical data. It empowers users to make informed decisions by providing various map visualizations and robust data processing capabilities. By combining a .NET Core backend, PostgreSQL database, and Angular frontend, this application delivers a seamless and efficient experience for handling spatial data.
